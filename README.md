# Playwright Project

Welcome to the Playwright Project repository! This repository houses a Playwright project that I embarked on while diving into the depths of Playwright, a powerful framework for web testing and automation. Through this project, I aim to explore Playwright's capabilities, from browser automation to end-to-end testing, ensuring web applications function as expected across all modern browsers.

## Getting Started

This section provides you with instructions on setting up the project locally, so you can explore its features or contribute to its development.

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm (typically installed with Node.js)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LVSoftwareTesting/Playwright.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Playwright
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. To start using Playwright for testing, run the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

This command will execute tests specified in the project. You can modify or add more tests as per your requirements.

## Running Tests

To run your tests, use the command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You can also run tests for specific browsers or with custom configurations. For detailed usage and options, refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

## Project Structure

This project is organized to facilitate easy navigation and understanding. Key directories include:

- `tests/` - Contains the test scripts written with Playwright.
- `pageObjects/` - (If used) Stores Page Object models for abstracting page details.
- `configs/` - Contains configuration files for different environments or setups.
